# This differs from maxIdleTime in that it refers to absolute age.
# Even a Connection which has not been much idle will be purged from the pool if it exceeds maxConnectionAge.
# Zero means no maximum absolute age is enforced.
db.pool.maxConnectionAge: 0

# Seconds a Connection can remain pooled but unused before being discarded. Zero means idle connections never expire.
db.pool.maxIdleTime:
#
# Number of seconds that Connections in excess of minPoolSize should be permitted to remain idle in the pool before being
# culled. Intended for applications that wish to aggressively minimize the number of open Connections,
# shrinking the pool back towards minPoolSize if, following a spike, the load level diminishes and Connections
# acquired are no longer needed.
#
# If maxIdleTime is set, maxIdleTimeExcessConnections should be smaller if the parameter is to have any effect.
# Zero means no enforcement, excess Connections are not idled out.
db.pool.maxIdleTimeExcessConnections:

# If provided, will create an empty table of the specified name, and use queries against
# that table to test the Connection. Default, not used and only makes into effect when preferredTestQuery
