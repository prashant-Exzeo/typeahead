/**
 * Lifecycle state. Allows the following transitions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>INITIALIZED -> STARTED, STOPPED, CLOSED</li>
 * <li>STARTED     -> STOPPED</li>
 * <li>STOPPED     -> STARTED, CLOSED</li>
 * <li>CLOSED      -> </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Also allows to stay in the same state. For example, when calling stop on a component, the
 * following logic can be applied:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * public void stop() {
 *  if (!lifeccycleState.moveToStopped()) {
 *      return;
 *  }
 * // continue with stop logic
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Note, closed is only allowed to be called when stopped, so make sure to stop the component first.
 * Here is how the logic can be applied:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * public void close() {
 *  if (lifecycleState.started()) {
 *      stop();
 *  }
 *  if (!lifecycleState.moveToClosed()) {
 *      return;
 *  }
 *  // perofrm close logic here
 * }
 * </pre>
